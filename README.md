#  HOODMART

**HoodMart** is a mobile application that allows people to rent and lend tools within their neighborhood, with a local server running on the same machine in its current implementation.  
Instead of buying rarely used tools, users can find what they need nearby — saving money, reducing waste, and strengthening local communities.
